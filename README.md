### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Kelechi Okeke, and I'm a web developer with over 3 years of experience in building web applications. I'm proficient in JavaScript, React, Next, Node, and TypeScript.

Skills
JavaScript: I have a strong foundation in JavaScript, including ES6+ features, and can use it to create complex web applications.

React: I'm experienced in building scalable and maintainable web applications using React. I can create components, manage state, handle lifecycle methods, and use React hooks effectively.

Next: I've worked extensively with Next.js, building server-rendered applications, dynamic routing, and API routes. I'm familiar with features like static site generation, incremental static regeneration, and server-side rendering.

Node: I'm skilled in building backend APIs using Node.js, Express, and other popular Node frameworks. I'm familiar with creating RESTful APIs, handling authentication, and integrating with databases like MongoDB.

TypeScript: I've worked with TypeScript and understand its benefits, including static typing, code maintainability, and improved developer experience.

If you're interested in working together or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at [YOUR EMAIL] or connect with me on [YOUR LINKEDIN PROFILE].
