### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Kelechi Okeke

I'm a software developer with 3 years of experience, specializing in front-end development using technologies such as JavaScript, React, Next.js, and TypeScript, as well as back-end development using Node.js.
Over the past three years, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, ranging from small-scale web applications to large-scale enterprise solutions. Through these experiences, I've developed strong problem-solving skills, as well as a keen eye for detail and a dedication to writing clean, maintainable code.
I'm always looking to learn and grow as a developer, and I'm excited to continue exploring new technologies and approaches to software development. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
